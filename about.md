The term “[cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail)” as an alcoholic drink was first documented in 1806. Just 15 years before then, the term “[statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics)” was first translated into English in 1791. And by the 1860s, it was common to refer to a mix of orange curaçao, absinthe, and other liqueurs as “[the old-fashioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned)“. Coincidentally, just about another 15 years before this, the first book to have “statistics” in its title was published in 1845. 

Clearly the development of these two wildly different ideas were unrelated to each other. The historical coincidence should not be over interpreted, and neither should the title of this blog. 

**So if not about cocktails, then what is the blog about?**

The blog is intended to explain, research, and experiment with fascinating ideas relating to quantitative finance. This includes experimenting with trading ideas (although not investment advice), and mathematical theory that cannot be directly applied.

More importantly, I will give my best attempt to prepare “[freshman lectures](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Richard_Feynman#Teaching_quote)“ on all my posts. According to the great Richard Feynman, if I can’t explain my idea to all my readers regardless of background, I probably don’t understand it.

**Why old-fashioned you might ask?**

It’s an excellent drink.
