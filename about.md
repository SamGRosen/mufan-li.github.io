According to Wikipedia, the term “cocktail” was first documented in 1806. Just 15 years before then, the term “[statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics)” was first translated into English in 1791. And by the 1860s, it was common to refer to a mix of orange curaçao, absinthe, and other liqueurs as “[the old-fashioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned)“. Coincidentally, just about another 15 years before this, the first book to have “statistics” in its title was published in 1845.

Clearly the development of the two wildly different ideas were unrelated to each other. The historical coincidence should not be over interpreted, and neither should the title of this blog. In fact, don’t expect the blog posts to necessarily relate. I am a curious graduate student with a wide range of interests. Expect everything from the theories of pure mathematics, to the heuristics in real application.

More importantly, do expect my best attempt to prepare a “[freshman lecture](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Richard_Feynman#Teaching_quote)“. According to the great Richard Feynman, if I can’t explain my idea to all my readers regardless of background, I probably don’t understand it.

Why old-fashioned you might ask? It’s an excellent drink.
